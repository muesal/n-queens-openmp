\section{Experiments}

We implement the algorithms of Section~\ref{sec:algorithms} in C, for details on the implementation refer to the \href{https://github.com/muesal/n-queens-openmp}{GitHub repository}.

All experiments are performed on \href{https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/}{Kebnekaise}.
For each configuration we execute the program 5 times and take the average running time of these runs.

We have two different types of experiments.
For the first one we choose a fixed number of queens, and compare the run times when using different numbers of threads.
In order to have interesting test results, we choose the smallest $n$, for which the serial algorithm has a running time of about 10 minutes. 
This is $n=16$, for which the serial algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:queens_serial}) has a running time of 618 seconds on average.
The number of threads runs from 1 to 28, which is the number of cores on Kebnekaise's compute nodes.

For the second one, we set the number of threads and solve the problem for increasing numbers of queens.
We choose 8 and 28 as the number of threads, as 8 turns out to be the number of threads with highest speedup in the first experiment.
We range $n$ from 10 to 17.
For less than 10 queens the problem can be solved within an instant, and 17 queens is the largest problem that can be solved within a reasonable amount of time with 8 threads.
