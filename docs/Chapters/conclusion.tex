\section{Conclusion}

This work consisted of developing a parallel algorithm for counting the number of solutions for the n-queens problem for a given number of queens.
Experiments showed, that the method that was used to split the work between multiple threads introduces too much overhead.
For the 16-queens problem, a speedup of 2.16 could be achieved.
